# Synopsis

Working with C++ in the 21st Century requires being familiar with the *modern* practice of C++.
C++ is an actively maintained language standard that continues to evolve, even at the time of our creation of this tutorial.

# Source Material

This is based on our UnoAPI book at https://unoapi.org/. 

The actual lecture materials are at https://unoapi.org/15-modern-cpp/modern-cpp.html.

More to come, including how to build/run. We provide ``CMake`` and Colab builds. As this is not SYCL-specific, we do not provide DevCloud versions (yet).
