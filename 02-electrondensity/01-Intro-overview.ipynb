    "# 02 - Electron density\n",
    "\n",
    "Electron density is a pivotal function in computational chemistry, representing the probability distribution of electrons in a quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Electron density is an 'observable' quantity, allowing its measurement through experimental techniques such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, unlike the wave function or molecular orbitals. Electron density is a real, three-dimensional function irrespective of the number of particles in the system. In contrast, the wave function extends across a multidimensional space, specifically 4N dimensions—three for spatial coordinates and one for spin—where N denotes the number of particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the framework of density functional theory (DFT), the foundational Hohenberg-Kohn theorems assert that the electron density uniquely determines all the ground state properties of a system, encapsulating all its quantum mechanical information. Consequently, other properties, such as the total energy, are functionals of the electron density. DFT has emerged as a cornerstone in the fields of computational chemistry and materials science due to its effectiveness and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing electron density provides insights into various chemical phenomena, including the nature of chemical bonds, reactivity patterns, and molecular properties such as electrostatic potential. This analysis is fundamental in predicting molecular behavior and facilitating the design of new molecules and materials.\n"
